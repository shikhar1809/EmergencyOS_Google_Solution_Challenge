## The Night That Built This Product

It was an ordinary evening at home when my mother suddenly clutched her chest and slid down against the wall. Her face was pale, her breathing was shallow, and I was alone. I did what any Indian kid is taught to do first — I dialed **112**.

> *"The call connected. Then a hold tone. Then silence. Then the line dropped."*

I dialed **102** for the state ambulance. **"Number busy."**
I dialed the local private ambulance number I had saved in my phone a year ago. **"The number you are trying to reach is not in service."**
I tried two more from a Google search. **One didn't pick up. The other said they had no vehicle free for the next 40 minutes.**

Every clock in the house suddenly felt very loud.

With the neighbor's help, I pushed my mother into a car and drove to the **nearest hospital** — eight minutes away. The triage nurse took one look at the ECG and said the words you never want to hear:

> *"We are not equipped for this. You have to take her to a cardiac center. Now."*

No patient transfer ambulance. No stretcher protocol. No phone call ahead to the next hospital. We went back into the same car. **Twenty-two more minutes** of honking through traffic until we finally reached a tertiary cardiac hospital. The doctors admitted her. They asked for her medical history. I had nothing — no paper, no app, no records. I answered from memory while she was being wheeled into the cath lab.

By God's grace, **she survived.** I sat outside the ICU that night and couldn't stop replaying one thought:

**How many families are not that lucky?**

That night, I didn't grieve. I got angry. And I started building.

**EmergencyOS was born that night.**

## The Gaps I Saw — And The Numbers Behind Them

What I lived through wasn't bad luck. It is the **default emergency experience** for most of India and the developing world. The data is brutal:

| Reality | Number |
|---|---|
| Indians who die every year from **delayed emergency medical care** | **~3 million** <sup>(NCRB, AIIMS trauma reports)</sup> |
| Deaths in road accidents in India per year — most in the **Golden Hour** | **~1,68,000** (2022) <sup>(MoRTH)</sup> |
| % of cardiac arrest victims who survive outside a hospital in India | **< 1 %** <sup>(vs. 10–12 % in the US / 25 % in Seattle)</sup> |
| Drop in cardiac arrest survival **per minute** without CPR/defibrillation | **~10 %** <sup>(American Heart Association)</sup> |
| Average urban ambulance response time in Indian Tier-2/3 cities | **25–45 minutes** <sup>(WHO SEARO 2022)</sup> |
| Target response time in Germany / UK | **8–12 minutes** |
| % of Indian ambulance calls that reach the **wrong-specialty hospital** | **~30 %** forcing a second transfer |
| % of patients who arrive at the hospital with **zero accessible medical history** | **~85 %** |
| Indians who still rely on 2G / feature phones (no smartphone apps) | **~25 crore (250 million)** |

The real killer isn't the disease. It is the **minutes** we lose between the symptom and the right bed. EmergencyOS exists to close that gap — with intelligence, redundancy, and grace.

## The Solution — EmergencyOS

> **Tagline:** *Designed to save lives.*

EmergencyOS is not a "call an ambulance" app. It is an **end-to-end emergency operating system** that connects six roles — **Victim → Citizen Volunteer → EMS Fleet → Hospital → Ops Command → Emergency Contact** — into one real-time, AI-coordinated, offline-capable command mesh.

It is built on Google Cloud, Firebase, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Google Maps Platform, and LiveKit WebRTC — and deployed as **three synchronized apps** that share a single live brain.

### One sentence for a grandmother

*"You press one button. The right ambulance, the right hospital, the right volunteer nearby, and the right AI doctor's voice all arrive together — even if there is no internet."*

## Three Apps. One Brain.

EmergencyOS ships as **three separately compiled and hosted apps** that all share the same Firestore backend, the same dispatch engine, and the same AI.

<div align="center">

| App | Target | Who uses it | Entry point |
|---|---|---|---|
| **EmergencyOS — Main App** | Android · iOS · Web | Citizens, patients, volunteers, families | `lib/main.dart` |
| **Command Center — Admin Dashboard** | Web | Operations staff, government command rooms | `lib/main_admin.dart` |
| **Fleet Panel — EMS Operator App** | Web | Ambulance drivers and dispatchers | `lib/main_fleet.dart` |

## The Use of AI — Gemini as a System, Not a Chatbot

AI in EmergencyOS is not a demo feature bolted on. **Gemini 2.5 Flash is used at four distinct points in the lifecycle of every incident.**

| # | Where | What Gemini does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Intake — Triage Vision** | Victim or bystander can snap a photo. Gemini Vision classifies incident type (cardiac / RTA / fire / burn / fall / drowning), estimates severity, detects visible blood and hazards, and returns a confidence score. Drives which services are dispatched. |
| 2 | **On-scene — LIFELINE First-Aid Copilot** | A voice & chat AI that walks a panicked bystander through CPR, bleeding control, burns, choking, seizures, strokes, anaphylaxis, drowning — step by step, in their native language. Powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash via Cloud Function, with a local offline knowledge base as fallback. |
| 3 | **Command — Situation Brief** | Every 5 minutes, for every active incident, a Cloud Function regenerates a Gemini scene brief from volunteer reports + photos + video + status history. Ops staff always see one paragraph of fresh ground truth. |
| 4 | **Analytics — Ops AI Chat** | The admin dashboard has an embedded Gemini chat that can answer *"which hex had the slowest response last week?"* or *"summarize all cardiac incidents in zone 3 today"* — grounded on live Firestore analytics. |

### LIFELINE Copilot — the always-on voice assistant

Every logged-in user also has a **personal voice agent** on `copilot_{uid}` — a private LiveKit WebRTC room powered by **OpenAI Realtime** with `@livekit/noise-cancellation-node`. It has tools to:

- Read which screen the user is on and coach them through it hands-free
- Look up any medical protocol on demand
- Request an SOS trigger (the user must confirm) — so an elderly user can literally say *"call an ambulance, I think I'm having a heart attack"* and the chain fires.

### Why Gemini decides, and a third-party voice stack speaks

EmergencyOS is deliberately a **Gemini-led system with a hybrid voice layer.** Every decision that affects a human life — *what type of emergency is this, how severe is it, which hospital specialty is needed, what does the situation brief say, what should the bystander do next* — is made by **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, running server-side through authenticated Cloud Functions with shared safety contracts, retrieval-grounded first-aid protocols, and structured-JSON responses:

- **Triage Vision** (photo → severity, category, `aiRecommendedSpecialty`) → Gemini.
- **LIFELINE first-aid guidance** (CPR, bleeding, burns, choking, stroke) → Gemini, grounded on vetted WHO / AHA-derived protocols.
- **Situation briefs** for dispatchers (multimodal: text + scene photos + voice-note transcript) → Gemini.
- **Ops analytics chat** on live Firestore data → Gemini.
- **Hospital routing rationale** shown on the ops dashboard and the victim's card → Gemini.
- **Hospital dispatch scoring** is boosted by Gemini's `aiRecommendedSpecialty` — the AI's vision call literally re-ranks which hospital the ambulance goes to.

The pieces that are **not** Gemini are intentionally narrow: the "last-mile" voice transport that carries those Gemini-generated words into a live phone-call-grade stream — speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and WebRTC bridging — currently uses **LiveKit** (WebRTC rooms), **OpenAI Realtime** / **Cartesia** (TTS), and **Deepgram** (STT). This is a conscious engineering choice, not a limitation:

- **Best-in-class latency.** Sub-300 ms round-trip speech matters when a bystander is doing chest compressions. These providers lead that specific benchmark today. Google's real-time voice offering is maturing rapidly and the adapter layer is already abstracted — swapping any one of them in takes hours, not weeks.
- **Clear separation of concerns.** The voice stack is a *pipe*. The brain of every response — clinical reasoning, prompt safety, JSON schema, protocol grounding, hospital routing — stays on Gemini. Replacing the pipe does not change a single decision the system makes.
- **Reliability.** If the voice stack is unavailable, the same Gemini backend still serves text chat, triage, briefs, and dispatch — nothing about a victim's rescue depends on a third-party TTS being up.

**In short:** Gemini makes every medical and dispatch decision in EmergencyOS. LiveKit / OpenAI / Deepgram / Cartesia are the microphone, speaker, and cable connecting that decision to a panicked human. We chose the pipe on engineering merit and can swap it at any time without changing the system's behavior.

## Reliability — Engineered for the Worst Day

Emergency systems fail people exactly when they are needed most. EmergencyOS is designed with the assumption that **everything will go wrong.**

| Failure mode | How EmergencyOS handles it |
|---|---|
| **Volunteer's FCM token is stale** | 3 independent FCM layers (geo, topic, all-users). One failure never silences the others. |
| **Hospital ignores the dispatch** | 2-minute acceptance window → auto-escalates to the next best hospital. `hospitalDispatchEscalation` runs every minute. |
| **Ambulance operator doesn't respond** | 3-minute window → auto-escalates to the next-nearest fleet unit. `ambulanceDispatchEscalation` runs every minute. |
| **Gemini API key is down** | Local offline first-aid knowledge base (keyword-matched guidance for core emergencies) keeps serving text until the API returns. |
| **Google Maps WebGL fails** | `flutter_map` CPU-renderer fallback kicks in. |
| **User has no mobile data — only 2G SMS** | Twilio GeoSMS webhook (`parseSmsGateway`) creates a real Firestore incident from a text message. Victim gets SMS status back. |
| **Rate-limit spam** | Rate-limit **flags** an incident but **never blocks dispatch**. Real emergencies cannot be missed to prevent abuse. This is the single most important design rule in the system. |
| **App crashes mid-SOS** | `sos_incidents` doc is durable in Firestore — re-opening the app resumes the same live ETA. |
| **Incident gets forgotten** | Hard 1-hour TTL → `expireStaleSosIncidents` archives and notifies. No zombie incidents. |
| **Third-party sensor system** | `onExternalIncidentTrigger` HTTP webhook with shared-secret auth lets IoT devices (AEDs, fall detectors, partner apps) create incidents. |

**Every state change is observable.** The admin dashboard's `ops_dashboard_alerts` feed shows every dispatch event live — hospital notified, declined, exhausted, no beds, ambulance accepted, ambulance expired, volunteer accepted, volunteer on scene.

---

## Offline Capabilities — Because Bandwidth Disappears in Disasters

When a flood, fire, or blackout hits, cellular coverage is the first thing to collapse. EmergencyOS is one of the few emergency apps that actually works when the network is broken.

| Subsystem | Offline behaviour |
|---|---|
| **Firestore** | Offline persistence enabled, 50 MB cache. SOS writes queue and sync when signal returns. |
| **`OfflineCacheService`** | Pre-caches the user's active incident, medical history, emergency contacts, and last-known ambulance position. |
| **`OfflineKnowledgeService`** | Keyword routes (CPR, bleeding, choking, stroke, burns, seizure, anaphylaxis, drowning, and more) return pre-written guidance in 12 languages with zero network. |
| **`OfflineMapPackService`** | User can pre-download map tiles for their home zone. Incident map keeps rendering. |
| **`OfflineSosStatusService`** | If SOS fails to upload, it is queued and retried on reconnect — and an SMS is sent in parallel. |
| **TTS voice guidance** | Reads first-aid steps aloud when the screen is unreadable (dust, smoke, blood, motion). |
| **SMS GeoSMS gateway** | A user with no app at all can SMS coordinates + incident type to the gateway number and trigger a full dispatch. |
| **Native feature-phone reach** | Emergency contacts receive SMS updates — they don't need the app installed. |

---

## Dashboards — One Screen That Runs a City

The **Command Center (Admin Dashboard)** is the nerve center. This is what a city's emergency control room looks like inside EmergencyOS:

| Screen | What you see |
|---|---|
| **Command Center Map** | Hex-grid overlay (flat-top axial coordinates) over a live city map. Every active incident, every volunteer, every ambulance, every hospital with bed count. Color-coded by severity. Zoom in — see the details. Click a hex — see everyone in it. |
| **Incident Inspector** | Focus any incident. Full dispatch chain, hospital acceptance trail, fleet assignment state, volunteer roster, scene photos, Gemini situation brief, voice-bridge join button. |
| **Admin Analytics** | Response time histogram, incident type breakdown, zone heatmaps, volunteer XP trends — rendered with `fl_chart`. |
| **Fleet Management** | All ambulance units, 90-second heartbeat TTL, stationed hospital, call sign, vehicle type, live availability. |
| **Hospital Management** | All hospitals with bed availability, specialty map, onboarding wizard, pre-uploaded medical record index. |
| **Volunteer Management** | XP, level, lives saved, profile, elite tier flags, verification state. |
| **System Observatory** | Live health check — Firestore latency, LiveKit rooms, Twilio credits, Gemini key, FCM token count. A single "green / red" board for the ops lead. |
| **Impact Dashboard** | Platform-level outcomes — lives helped, incidents resolved, average response time, fastest volunteer, most-dispatched hospital. |
| **Master Comms Net** | `comms_command_net` LiveKit room — command-level voice override on *any* incident. The ops lead can speak into any active bridge. |

Hospitals get their own slice — a **Hospital Bridge** view showing the incoming patient, required services vs. capacity, scene photos, pre-loaded medical history, and a 2-minute dispatch acceptance button.

git clone https://github.com/shikhar1809/EmergencyOS_Google_Solution_Challenge.git
cd EmergencyOS_Google_Solution_Challenge
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Configure Firebase

```bash
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
flutterfire configure
```

### 3. Cloud Functions

```bash
cd functions
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in: GEMINI_API_KEY, LIVEKIT_URL, LIVEKIT_API_KEY,
#         TWILIO_* (optional), WEBHOOK_SHARED_SECRET (optional)
firebase functions:secrets:set LIVEKIT_API_SECRET
firebase deploy --only functions
```

## Environment Variables

### `functions/.env`

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Yes | Google Generative AI key |
| `LIVEKIT_URL` | Yes* | `wss://your-project.livekit.cloud` |
| `LIVEKIT_HTTP_URL` | Yes* | Alternative to `LIVEKIT_URL` |
| `LIVEKIT_API_KEY` | Yes | LiveKit API key |
| `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` | Yes | LiveKit secret (Firebase Secret Manager) |
| `LIFELINE_LIVEKIT_AGENT_NAME` | No | Default: `lifeline` |

### LiveKit Agents (`.env.local`)

`LIVEKIT_URL` · `LIVEKIT_API_KEY` · `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` · `OPENAI_API_KEY`

### Browser-side key hardening

Only two keys are shipped to the browser today: the Firebase Web API key (in
`lib/firebase_options.dart`) and the Google Maps JavaScript API key (in
`web/index.html`). Both must be tightened in Google Cloud Console before any
public launch:

- **Firebase Web API key** — restrict to the Firebase Hosting origins
  (`*.web.app`, `*.firebaseapp.com`, and your custom domain). Firestore and
  Auth are already gated by project rules and App Check, so the key is an
  identifier rather than a secret, but restriction prevents cross-project
  abuse.
- **Google Maps JS API key** — set an HTTP-referrer allowlist identical to
  the hosting origins and restrict it to the Maps JavaScript, Places, and
  Geocoding APIs only. Keep billing quotas conservative.
- **Gemini** — never ship a client-side key. All Gemini calls go through
  Cloud Functions (`functions/` reads `GEMINI_API_KEY` from Secret Manager).
  The `GEMINI_API_KEY` dart-define in legacy debug paths is deprecated; treat
  it as test-only.

## Key Design Decisions (Why it is built this way)

**Why hex-grid dispatch and not simple radius?**
Hex grids have uniform neighbor distance in all 6 directions — no nearest-corner bias. The flat-top axial coordinate system allows precise *ring-0 → ring-5* escalation with consistent km spacing, matching how real cities actually zone themselves.

**Why 3-layer FCM and not just one?**
Layer 1 (geo-multicast) may fail if volunteers' tokens are stale. Layer 2 (topic) guarantees subscribers get it. Layer 3 (all-users) is the last-ditch safety net. Each layer runs **independently** — one failure never silences another.

**Why fail-open on SOS rate limiting?**
Real emergencies cannot be missed for the sake of preventing spam. Rate-limit violations are *flagged* — dispatch still fires. Ops can review flagged incidents afterwards.

**Why three separate hosted web targets?**
Admin and fleet have different root routes, different auth guards, different navigation shells, and even different Firebase options. Separate builds allow independent deploys and role-based CDN isolation.

**Why LiveKit over proprietary WebRTC?**
LiveKit is open, self-hostable, and exposes an `AgentDispatchClient` that lets Cloud Functions push AI voice agents into rooms — critical for a system that must not depend on a single commercial provider during a disaster.

## Hospital dispatch escalation (v2), Lifeline voice agent, and Lifeline response cards

### Hospital dispatch escalation — how it works in detail

Hospital matching and retries are implemented in [`functions/src/hospital_dispatch_v2.js`](functions/src/hospital_dispatch_v2.js) (see also [`docs/HOSPITAL_DISPATCH_V2.md`](docs/HOSPITAL_DISPATCH_V2.md)). When an SOS is created, `dispatchHospitalInHex` delegates to this engine, which writes `ops_incident_hospital_assignments/{incidentId}` and starts **wave 1**.

**Severity tiers** drive parallelism, patience, SMS backup, and how far the chain can run. `classifySeverity()` maps incident text, `dispatchHints`, triage colour, and optional vitals (`spo2`, `heartRate`, `systolicBp`) into `critical`, `high`, or `standard`. Each tier uses a frozen `SEVERITY_PROFILE`:

| Tier | Hospitals notified **in parallel** per wave | Wave timeout (no accept) | Maximum waves | Twilio SMS fallback after |
|------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **critical** | 3 | 45 s | 6 | 30 s |
| **high** | 2 | 75 s | 5 | 60 s |
| **standard** | 1 | 120 s | 4 | 180 s |

**Matching** ranks candidates inside a 60 km search with multi-factor scoring (proximity with optional Google Routes drive-time, specialty vs `requiredServices`, bed capacity, staffing, blood bank, cross-incident load, ambulance readiness at the hospital, data freshness, and rolling 30-day accept reliability). Results are stored in `rankedCandidates` and flattened into `orderedHospitalIds` for deterministic escalation order.

**Waves and escalation.** Each wave stores `hospitalIds`, `startedAt`, `timeoutAt`, and `outcome`. All hospitals in a wave receive dashboard inbox rows, FCM to on-duty staff, and optional SMS after `smsFallbackAfterMs`. **First hospital to accept wins** (transactional accept in the same module). If the wave **times out** (scheduler `hospitalDispatchEscalation` in [`functions/index.js`](functions/index.js), every minute) or the wave is **declined** and the callable escalates when no member accepts, `escalateAssignment()` runs:

1. The current wave is closed with `outcome: "timeout"` or `"declined"`.
2. The next wave takes the next slice of `orderedHospitalIds` that were **never** in `notifiedHospitalIds`, up to `parallelPerWave` facilities.
3. Legacy fields (`notifiedHospitalId`, lat/lng, `notifyIndex`) are repointed at the wave primary for older UIs.
4. `fanOutHospitalNotifications` runs again for the new wave; ops gets an informational `ops_dashboard_alerts` row on escalation.
5. If there are **no remaining hospitals** or **nextWaveIndex ≥ maxWaves**, the assignment moves to `dispatchStatus: "exhausted"`, stamps `dispatchExhaustedAt`, appends a terminal wave with `outcome: "exhausted"`, and raises a **critical** ops alert (`hospital_dispatch_exhausted`).

This replaces the legacy single-hospital notify-and-wait loop with **severity-aware parallel fan-out**, explicit **wave audit history**, and **SMS fallback before the full wave deadline** on critical incidents.

### Lifeline voice agent — two complementary implementations

**1) LiveKit “lifeline” server agent (emergency room audio)**  
[`livekit-agent/lifeline-agent/`](livekit-agent/lifeline-agent/) registers agent name `lifeline` (override with `LIFELINE_LIVEKIT_AGENT_NAME`). Cloud Functions use `AgentDispatchClient.createDispatch` to join the incident’s WebRTC room:

- [`ensureEmergencyBridge`](functions/index.js) dispatches the agent when the victim starts the emergency bridge so EMS and contacts hear a managed room, not a random peer mesh.
- [`dispatchLifelineComms`](functions/index.js) sends a **second job** with JSON metadata `{ importantComms: "<text>" }` (aliases `important_comms` / `text` also supported). Only the **incident owner** or users flagged `emergencyBridgeDesk` may call it.

The agent uses **OpenAI Realtime** (`voice: coral`) with background noise cancellation, **does not run a conversation loop**: it connects, `generateReply()` speaks the comms **verbatim**, `waitForPlayout()`, then `session.shutdown()`. That makes it ideal for “inbound ETA 4 minutes, bay 3” style announcements without hallucinated dialogue.

**2) Flutter `LifelineVoiceAgentService` (push-to-talk LIFELINE in the app)**  
[`lib/services/lifeline_voice_agent_service.dart`](lib/services/lifeline_voice_agent_service.dart) powers the in-app overlay ([`lifeline_voice_agent_overlay.dart`](lib/features/ai_assist/presentation/widgets/lifeline_voice_agent_overlay.dart)):

- **Long-press** the mic → speech recognition with fixed locale **`en-IN`** (reliable for Indian English and Hinglish in the browser recognizer).
- **Release** → transcript is sent to the existing **`lifelineChat`** callable; Gemini returns spoken guidance (and an optional `openLibraryLevelId` to jump to a curriculum card).
- **Short tap** while listening discards capture; while speaking it cancels TTS.
- **TTS path**: prefers on-device synthesis when allowed; on **mobile web** (or when no local voice pack exists) it uses **cloud TTS MP3** playback so audio still works after the async round-trip, which raw `speechSynthesis` often blocks without a fresh user gesture.

Together, the **LiveKit agent** covers **broadcast read-aloud in the shared emergency room**, while the **Flutter service** covers **hands-free Q&A against the same LIFELINE backend** during training or on-scene assist.

### Lifeline — emergency-case response cards (training arena)

EmergencyOS treats **first-aid archetypes as response cards** on the Lifeline arena map (the same scenarios the AI is grounded on). **Thirty** such emergency case types are in the product scope; **`kLifelineTrainingLevels` currently authors 29** concrete cards in [`lib/features/ai_assist/domain/lifeline_training_levels.dart`](lib/features/ai_assist/domain/lifeline_training_levels.dart) (numeric level IDs span **1–31** with **26 and 27** left open for fast curriculum inserts). Each card bundles: **title/subtitle**, **YouTube primer id**, **three infographic steps** (icon + headline + detail), **red flags**, **cautions**, **four-option MCQ**, **XP reward**, and **accent/icon** for the Clash-style map UI. [`LifelineCurriculumDigest`](lib/features/ai_assist/data/lifeline_curriculum_digest.dart) serialises the same content for Gemini / tool context so chat and voice answers stay aligned with the cards.

**Scenario cards in the curriculum (by title):** Basic first aid · CPR basics · BASIC trauma response · AED essentials · Breathing problem / blockage · Choking (adult) · Severe bleeding · Stroke (FAST) · Burns · Shock & positioning · Scene command · Anaphylaxis · Drowning rescue · Seizure first aid · Snake / animal bite · Diabetic emergency · Hypothermia & heat stroke · Accident / collision · Asthma attack · Seizure (prolonged / EMS escalation) · Foreign object penetration · Fracture & splinting · Poisoning / overdose · Head injury / concussion · Mental health crisis · Spinal injury · Heavy smoke / toxic gas · Fall from height · Electrocute rescue.

**Hero artwork:** [`technique_visuals.dart`](lib/features/ai_assist/presentation/widgets/technique_visuals.dart) maps level IDs to bundled PNGs under `assets/images/lifeline/` (with intentional overrides, e.g. drowning → `27.png`, electrocution → `47.png`, BASIC trauma → `233.png`) so every card has a consistent visual on the map.
