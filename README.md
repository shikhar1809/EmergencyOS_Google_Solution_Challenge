## The Story Behind EmergencyOS

It was an ordinary college morning when my phone rang.

My father's voice was steady, but the words cut through everything — *"Come to the hospital. Your mother nearly had a cardiac arrest."*

She was saved — not by any system, not by any infrastructure — but by a neighbour who happened to be home that day, and by my father's desperate, last-minute decision to rush her to a super-speciality hospital himself.

We called an ambulance.

**It never arrived.**

In the days that followed, with the adrenaline wearing off, the questions set in:

> *What if our neighbours hadn't been home?*
> *What if we couldn't reach the hospital in time?*
> *What if that hospital hadn't been equipped for her condition?*

These aren't rare fears. They are a daily reality for hundreds of millions of Indians.

## The Scale of the Crisis

This is not a niche problem. The data is unambiguous.

| Metric | Statistic | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Annual deaths where timely emergency care could have made a difference | **Millions** | [MoRTH + ICMR, 2025](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.14.25337828v3.full.pdf) |
| Emergencies reaching hospital via ambulance | **Only 43%** | [ICMR Review, 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10692338/) |
| Cases where total emergency care accessibility time ≥ 60 min (Golden Hour missed) | **Majority of highway accidents** | [PMC, 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11006034/) |
| Road accident deaths per year — most within the Golden Hour | **~1,68,000 (2022)** | [MoRTH Press Release](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1973295) |
| Accident victims reaching care within the critical survival window | **Only ~20%** | [Health & Human Rights Journal, 2025](https://www.hhrjournal.org/2025/09/30/saving-time-saving-lives-the-golden-hour-as-a-constitutional-guarantee-in-india/) |
| Ambulances available under National Health Mission for 1.4 billion people | **~22,245** | [IAS Gyan](https://www.iasgyan.in/daily-current-affairs/why-emergency-care-needstobe-prioritisedl) |

> **The nearest hospital is not always the right hospital.** India's emergency care system is fragmented, under-resourced, and inaccessible where it is needed most. — [Niti Aayog / The Print](https://theprint.in/health/lack-of-senior-doctors-only-3-5-hospital-beds-niti-aayog-finds-big-gaps-in-emergency-care/779821/)

India needed something **fast, effective, and accessible** enough to close this emergency response gap. 

We built **EmergencyOS**.

## Introducing EmergencyOS

EmergencyOS is a **Distributed Emergency Response Platform** — an end-to-end system that connects victims, volunteers, fleet operators, hospitals, and command centres into a single, real-time emergency coordination network.

It stands on **four pillars**:

```
┌────────────────────────┐   ┌────────────────────────────┐
│   📱 Victim / Volunteer │   │  🚑 Fleet Operator App      │
│   Mobile App           │   │  (EMS Crew Coordination)   │
│   emergencyos-main     │   │  emergencyos-fleet          │
└────────────────────────┘   └────────────────────────────┘
┌────────────────────────┐   ┌────────────────────────────┐

---

## Technical Differentiators & USP

### ⚡ Full Dispatch Chain — Under 2 Seconds

EmergencyOS does not rely on human operators to initiate a response. The moment a victim taps SOS, a fully automated chain executes in under 2 seconds.

![Dispatch Chain Flow](assets/images_readme/dispatch_chain.png)

| Step | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **1. SOS Trigger** | Victim taps the red SOS button. Location, medical profile, and triage type are captured instantly. |
| **2. Gemini Triage** | Google Gemini AI classifies the emergency severity (`critical` / `high` / `standard`) from the incident type and context. |
| **3. 3-Layer FCM Alert** | Firebase Cloud Messaging pushes alerts to nearby volunteers simultaneously — bypassing Do Not Disturb via high-priority data messages. |
| **4. Wave-Based Hospital Dispatch** | The intelligent dispatch engine fires parallel alerts to the top-ranked hospitals. |
| **5. EMS Dispatched** | An ambulance crew receives the consignment on their mobile device with full turn-by-turn navigation. |

---

### 🌊 Dynamic Wave-Based Hospital Dispatch & Escalation

The core of EmergencyOS's intelligence is its hospital matching engine — a multi-factor scoring system that does not simply route to the nearest hospital, but to the **right** hospital.

![Dynamic Wave-Based Dispatch](assets/images_readme/wave_dispatch.png)

- **Intelligent Scoring System:** Ranks every hospital within a 60 km radius using 9 weighted factors: proximity, specialty match, available beds, active staffing, blood bank status, current workload, ambulance readiness, data freshness, and historical reliability.
- **Parallel "Wave" Dispatch:** For `critical` cases, the top 3 matching hospitals are alerted **simultaneously**. The first to accept wins the dispatch — all others are instantly cancelled.
- **Automated Escalation:** If no hospital accepts within 45 seconds, the system automatically rolls over to the next wave of fallback hospitals — up to 6 waves deep.
- **Multi-Channel Fail-safes:** Alarms are pushed to the command dashboard, bypassing mobile DND modes. Twilio SMS fallback texts are sent to the victim's registered phone if the app cannot be reached.

---

### 🤖 Advanced Emergency Data Flow — Powered by Gemini

EmergencyOS does not just move patients. It moves **information** — transforming raw, chaotic scene data into a structured medical briefing before the patient even arrives at the hospital.

![Advanced Emergency Data Flow](assets/images_readme/data_flow.png)

| Phase | Actor | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1 — On-Scene Capture** | Volunteer / First Responder | Captures scene photos, victim vitals, and triage data directly in the app. |
| **Phase 2 — En-Route Checklist** | Fleet Operator (Paramedic) | Logs consciousness, breathing, drugs administered, IV access, and chief complaints via a structured in-ride checklist. |
| **Phase 3 — Gemini Synthesis** | Gemini AI | Merges scene photos, triage data, and the en-route medical checklist into a structured clinical narrative. |
| **Phase 4 — Pre-Arrival Briefing** | Hospital ER Team | The synthesised report is pushed to the hospital dashboard **before the patient arrives** — team, room, and blood are ready. |

---

### 🎙️ AI Voice Guidance — Lifeline in Your Pocket

For a victim who is alone, injured, or panicked, a silent app is not enough.

![SOS Voice Flow](assets/images_readme/voice_flow.png)

EmergencyOS activates a real-time voice channel the moment SOS is triggered:

- **Native Language Support:** Voice guidance in Hindi and English (prototype), with a path to all regional languages.
- **Continuous Well-being Monitoring:** Checks in with the victim every 60 seconds — *"Are you conscious? Answer yes or no."* If three check-ins are missed, responders are alerted to an unresponsive patient.
- **Live Status Updates:** Every step of the response — volunteer accepted, ambulance dispatched, hospital assigned — is announced to the victim in real time via voice.
- **Emergency Voice Channel:** A real-time WebRTC (LiveKit) audio room connects the victim directly to their on-scene volunteer and hospital.

---

## Design Differentiators

EmergencyOS was designed for **the most stressful 60 minutes of a person's life.** Every design decision reflects that.

- **Panic-Proof UI:** One massive, unmissable SOS button. No menus to navigate in a crisis.
- **Dual-Mode Design:** Deep dark theme for reduced cognitive load during emergencies; high-contrast ops mode for field command use in daylight.
- **Information Hierarchy Under Pressure:** The SOS Active screen surfaces the most critical information first — responders en route, hospital assigned, ETA — with secondary information collapsed.
- **Low-Power Awareness:** The volunteer app displays a "Low Power" warning and degrades gracefully to conserve battery during active consignments.
- **Zero-Learning-Curve Operator Interfaces:** Hospital and fleet dashboards are built for speed — single-click acceptance, slide-to-confirm on-scene, structured checklists with visual progress.

## Future Development Plans

EmergencyOS is not a finished product — it is a foundation.

### 🩺 Addition of Staff App
A dedicated mobile app for on-call specialists and hospital staff. Hospitals will be able to push notifications directly to specific doctors — ensuring the right specialist is confirmed, paged, and in position **before the patient arrives**.

### 📡 Offline-First Architecture
The SOS dispatch pipeline will move to a **local-first, sync-on-connection** model. Volunteer alerts, hospital matching scores, and incident state will be cached locally and reconciled when connectivity resumes — critical for rural areas where connectivity is intermittent.
